The Stove configuration for GitHub does not contain an access token. In order to use the GitHub plugin, you must set an access token in the GitHub section of the `~/.stove' file:

    {
      "github": {
        "access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
      }
    }

You can generate an access token for GitHub by following the instructions at: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use.
