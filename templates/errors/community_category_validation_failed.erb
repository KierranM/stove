You did not specify a category! The Chef community site requires all cookbooks belong to a category. For existing cookboks, Stove can query the Chef community site API and automatically complete the category for you. However, for new cookbooks, you must specify the `--category' flag at runtime:

    stove --category Utilities

For a complete listing of categories, please see the Chef community site.
