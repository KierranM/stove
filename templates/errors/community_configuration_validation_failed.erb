The Stove configuration for the Chef community site does not exist! In order to perform operations against the Chef community site, you must set your username and path to your client key in the community section of the `~/.stove' file:

    {
      "community": {
        "username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
        "key": "YOUR_KEY_PATH"
      }
    }
